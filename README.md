# Open Chess

## What is this?

An implementation of Chess in C++ utilising the OpenFrameworks library.

## Why does it exist?

I wanted to familiarise myself with object-oriented programming (OOP) in the second year of my undergraduate studies. I enjoy chess a great deal, so this seemed as good a way of doing so as any.

- Unspaghetti-fy code
	- This program was written when I had relatively little experience in programming and, unfortunately, it shows.
